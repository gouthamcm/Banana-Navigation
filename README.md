# Banana-Navigation
This project trains an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.

The goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The project environment is similar to, but not identical to the Banana Collector environment on the [Unity ML-Agents GitHub page!](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#banana-collector).
